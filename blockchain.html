        <p>A block-chain is a database  that is shared across a network of computers. Once a record has been added to the chain it is very difficult to change. 
            To ensure all the copies of the database are the same, the network  makes constant checks.
            Block-chains have been used to underpin cyber-currencies ]
            like bitcoin, but many other possible uses  are emerging.</p>
        <h2>Important points on Block-Chains</h2>
        <ol>
             
<li>A Block-chain is a type of diary or spreadsheet containing information about transactions.</li>
<li>Each transaction generates a hash.</li>
<li>A hash is a string of numbers and letters.</li>
<li>Transactions are entered in the order in which they occurred. Order is very important.</li>
<li>The hash depends not only on the transaction but the previous transaction's hash.</li>
<li>Even a small change in a transaction creates a completely new hash.</li>
<li>The nodes check to make sure a transaction has not been changed by inspecting the hash.</li>
<li>If a transaction is approved by a majority of the nodes then it is written into a block.</li>
<li>Each block refers to the previous block and together make the Blockchain.</li>
<li>A Blockchain is effective as it is spread over many computers, each of which have a copy of the Blockchain.</li>
<li>These computers are called nodes.</li>
<li>The Blockchain updates itself every 10 minutes.</li>
